I worked with my team to implement a problem environment (PE) for use with the aima.core Java library. 
My team then presented the implementation to the class, as well as live demonstrations to show the results 
and analysis of running search experiments on problem instances.

AI search problem description - Missionaries and Cannibals

On the left bank of a river are three missionaries and three cannibals. 
There is one boat available that can hold up to two people when crossing the river. 
The boat cannot cross the river alone. 
If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river while the boat is crossing, 
the missionaries will be eaten. How can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals across 
to the right side of the river?
